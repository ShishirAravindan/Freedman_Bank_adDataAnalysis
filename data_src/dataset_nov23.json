the women with children in their arms storing away the proceeds derived from their labor, in washing, ironing, etc.; the old and sturdy son of africa, with hammer or a day\u2019s rations in his hand, on saturday evening, laying aside the remainder of his week\u2019s earnings to grow and increase by interest: the gay and festive barber, with mustache and hair trimmed with all the skill of the french artist preparing for the time when customers depart to return no more, when men's beards ceased to grow, and when nature resumes her sway. reader,\nwill either of these things ever occur?"},{"identifier":1873103003204.0,"Newspaper":"Atlanta Daily Herald","Bank":"Atlanta National Bank","Year":1873,"Month":10,"Day":30.0,"Title":"atlanta national bank","Text":"atlanta national bank of the city of atlanta. designated depository of the united states. capital, $300,000. directors. alfred austell, r. h. richaros, e. w. holland, john neal, s. m. inman, w. j. garren, w. b. cox. special attention is made to collections, for which we remit promptly at lowest rate of exchange. alfred austell. president: w. h. tuller, cashier;

with branches all through the country, just as fast as american soil should be rescued for freedom. \nthis was the first great provision made by the republic for its helpless millions of freedmen whom the crazy shot into fort sumpter had launched into our hands. it was right to do this, because it is always right to do right. i was kind to do it, because the south was her own enemy \u2013 not ours; and in her weakness she needed our strength; in her hate, if she had it \u2013 our love. so all praise be to salmon, p. chase, peter cooper, jay cooke and h.d. cooke, and everybody who helped the good act along \u2013 all praise to the congress which gave the charter, and \u201call glory be to god and henry of navarre.\u201d we only pay this passing tribute to the noblest american of his country \u2013 abraham lincoln \u2013 for his heart dictated and his hand wrote that eternal proclamation of freedom.\nthis noble charter for freedmen\u2019s savings banks was the first relay house of the african on his road to independence. it was his district school. it taught him the great lesson, that every free man who will work, can make more money than he needs, and save the balance against a rainy day. and the good work went on. savings banks were opened wherever the old flag was set floating over redeemed soil, and now we have this record. we insert the list of freedmen\u2019s savings banks as they were founded, and every one of which is now doing its good work: atlanta, ga. augusta, ga. baltimore, md. beaufort, s.c. charleston, s.c. chattanooga, tenn. columbus, miss. columbia, tenn. huntsville, ala. jacksonville, fla. lexington, ky. little rock, ark. louisville, ky. lynchburg, va. macon, ga. memphis, tenn. mobile, ala. montgomery, ala. natchez, miss. nashville, tenn. newbern, n.c. new orleans, la. new york city, n.y. norfolk, va. philadelphia, pa. raleigh, n.c. richmond, va. savannah, ga. shreveport, la. st. louis, mo. tallahasse, fla. vicksburg, miss. washington, d.c. wilmington, n.c.\nthus like a ministering angel, the savings banks followed close in the track of the freedmen \u2013 recalling, although reserving the sublime imagery of an elder nation who were led by \u201ca pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night,\u201d\n\u201cwhen angels walked in israel\u2019s van.\u201d\nit is beyond the compass of human calculation to estimate the good which these savings banks have done for the colored race. none but the all-seeing eye has looked upon, none but the all-knowing mind can comprehend it. \nthe conversations of that evening in the house of mr. chase will not soon be forgotten. the heavy storm-cloud of the war had not yet cleared away. the republic was still struggling like a lacoon in the folds of the serpent. but the doomed african race had to be made \u201cfree, or the union has to die.\u201d if we entered the promised land, we must take an emancipated people with us, and so it was agreed that it was better to give liberty to the slave than to go to the grave of the republic.\n"},{"identifier":1871042722201.0,"Newspaper":"New Orleans Republican","Bank":"FSB","Year":1871,"Month":4,"Day":27.0,"Title":"the freedmen savings and trust bank.","Text":"a national savings bank. chartered by the government of the united states. march, 1865. thirty-three branch offices hare already been established throughout the country. principal office: washington, district of columbia. j. w. alvord, president. d. l. eaton, actuary. new orleans branch: 114 \u2014 curondelet street \u2014 114. new orleans, louisiana.\ndeposits of any amount received. all accounts strictly private and confidential. all deposits are payable on demand with interest due. six per cent interest paid or compounded, free of all taxes three times in each year. especial advantages afforded to trustees, guardians ami others having in charge trust funds;

for these men were perfectly aware, in regard to the numerous class ii the south popularly known as freedmen, that their newly acquired liberty could not produce the benefits which freedom should bring, unless habits of saving as well as of industry were formed among them. strongly impressed with this idea, a number of gentlemen prominent in the republican party took the requisite measures, and in the mouth of march, 1965, an institution, with the title of the fsb, was chartered by act of congress and went into immediate operation. the managing officers of the institution and the trustees number some of the most responsible government officers and prominent business men in washington, new york, philadelphia, cincinnati, and other commercial cities in the union. henry d. cooke, of the firm of jay cooke & co., is chairman of the finance committee, and among the members are the second controller of the united states treasury, and an assistant treasurer of the united states.\n at the present time there are thirty three branches of the bank, of which one is located at shreveport, louisiana, and another in this city, having its office at no. 114 carondelet street.\nas the fsb is more especially intended for the class whose ignorance of commercial business renders them liable to imposition, great pains have been taken, not only to render the depositor sure oi his savings, but also to aecommodate him in every way. hence, a deposit may commence with five cents, and a depositor may draw out any or all of his money without any previous notice whatever. \nthe new orleans branch of the fsbwas established in 1816, and from the commencement its success was decided. the first cashier was, we think, c.s. sauvinet, esq., the present civil sheriff of orleans parish. when mr. sauvinet was elected sheriff. mr. c. d. sauvinet was appointed cashier and general manager. previously to his acceptance of the position, this gentleman had been receiving teller in the office of the assistant treasurer of the united states in this city. since mr. sturtevaut has undertaken the management of the bank, the business has largely increased; and at the present time there are a little over three thousand depositors, the amount deposited being fully two hundred and eight thousand dollars. there were forty-one new depositors during the past week, and there is every indication that the number will increase from month to month.\none especial advantage to depositors in this institution is that interest is paid on all deposits every three months, or else compounded and made a part of the principa. besides, when the profit over the expenses of the institution and branches amount to a sufficient dividend is declared, of which every depositor is entitled and receives a pro rate. \nalthough the organization of the freedmen\u2019s savings and trust company was in view, more especially, of the welfare and necessities of a particular class, its benefits are within the reach of all, and it would be a good thing if the workingmen of all descriptions were to avail themselves of the facilities offered for the accumulation of a competem by the deposit of small sums. a saving of twenty cents a day, or one dollar and forty cents per week. will in one year, with the present rate of interest allowed by the bank, amount to seventy-seven dollars and thirty-seven cents; and, going on at this rare for five years; the sum of over four hundred dollars will br accumulated.\nno greater service could be done to working men than to call their attention to add point out the benefits accruing from this institution. it is mo new remark that nothing more elevates a man into a sense of socail repomsibility and respectability than the sense of possessing such an interest in the community as arises from the possession of property.\nthe last official act performed by president lincoln was the signing of the congressional bill which gave legal existence to the national savings bank"},{"identifier":1874041022201.0,"Newspaper":"New Orleans Republican","Bank":"FSB","Year":1874,"Month":4,"Day":10.0,"Title":"the freedmen savings and trust bank.","Text":"the national fsb. a national savings bank, chartered by the united states, march, 1865. new orleans branch, no. 152 carondelet street, corner of dryndes. bank hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. open saturday nights to receive deposits from six to eight o'clock. six per cent interest allowed. c.d.sturtevant, cashier. a. paillet, assistant cashier.

[a general laugh]. an amusing story was told of an old negro, who had been quite industrious and mande considerable money, but suddenly became indolent and no longer tried to accumulate wealth. when called upon for an explanation, he said he didn't want any money, for when he had it it gave him too much trouble and made him unhappy. he had no secure place to keep it ; he used to keep his door locked, his windows nailed down, and his chimney stopped up, to keep it from being stolen, and yet he lost it, and therefore the only way to be happy was not to be bothered with money. several interesting stories were told about the disposition of funds raised by them for benevolent and missionary purposes, and how those funds had been used by store dealers for the purpose of trading in stores, but which could not have been done if they had had a bank of their own. in discussing this matter they manifested a surprising degree of business shrewdness and intelligence. one old man wanted to know what security they would have that their money would be safe? mr. hewitt told him that the company was composed of a large number of the best and wealthiest men in the united states, but as they were not personally responsible, he could only trust to their honor and integrity of character. were there any old rebels and slaveholders among them, continued the inquirer? no, said mr. hewitt, they are all northern men, and your friends. \u00ab den, dat's all right\u00a0\u00bb, was the response from several. \u00ab but \u00bb continued the old man, \u00ab what's done wid de money \u00bb. that, said, mr. hewitt, is invested in united states stocks. at this reply, the old financier stood a moment as if in profound meditation, and then said with apparent satisfaction. \u00ab well, den, de bank can't break widont de united states breaks, and dar's no danger of that, though de rebels tried a mighty hard to break it \u00bb, and took his seat amid a merry laugh. mr. hewitt proposed that they should consider this matter - call another meeting, and then appoint a committee to take the matter in hand ; but they told him that was not fast enough for them - they understood the matter - wanted the bank, and would immediately appoint a committee of fifteen to enter upon the business at once, which was done, and then passing a resolution of thanks for this new manifestation of friendship on the part of their white friends, resumed their church matters, and we retired surprised at the business intelligence and progressive character of these people.

the establishment of the fsb became the greatest auxiliary of freedom. therein culminated the intellectual, industrial, social, and we may add, moral forces of the new life of enfranchisement ; for with the comprehension and acceptance of the principal of the acquisition of wealth, and the improvement and beautifying of material life, comes the primary lesson of freedom and progressive civilization. we all remember, that after emancipation became an irreversible fact, philanthropists and reformers of every shade of opinion, placed a temporary quietus on their antagonims, and united in devising means for ameliorating the physical condition of the freed people and providing for their education. we recall the unanimity of sentiment with which the north, by its magnanimous contributions, pronounced the work of intellectual and religious development among the freed slaves, the noblest and most stupendous charity of the nineteenth century. soon after the inauguration of measures to carry out the generous design of the people, through the medium of freedmen's commissions, rev. j. w. alvord, of boston - who had been engaged in supplying reading matter to the army, and in organizing the first schools for the freedmen - had the idea presented to him that a systematic method of including the people to save a portion of their earnings, and make such disposition of it as would conduce to their pecuniary interests, would prove highly subsidiary to the diffusion of knowledge. it was not merely rudimentary instruction in the seemingly trivial matters of every day existence as well: in the sagacity which foresees ; the discernment which perceives the relation of cause and effect: and in the conduct of life generally. no measures, however, were concerted for the embodiment of this conception until the year subsequent. mr. alvord thus concisely details the circumstances which incited him to put the scheme into execution, and the successive steps taken for its accomplishment: \u00ab in the winter of 1864, when on a tour south, i found that the military bank established by gen. r. saxton was doing excellent service, but still there were large sums of bounty money of colored troops left loosely in the hands of officers, who might or might not return it, or pay it to heirs in case the soldier fell in the field. at hilton head an officer showed me a trunk in which he had $75,000 of such money, and promised to have it deposited in a savings bank if permanently chartered by proper authority. i came north full of the idea and called together gentlemen in new york who agreed to take hold of the enterprise.  a charter was at first prepared for the new york who agreed to take hold of the enterprise. a charter was at first prepared for the new york legislature, but on going to washington i became satisfied that we could obtain a charter from the general government, which would be far better, and so reported to the friends in new york. on feb. 6th, 1865, rev. geo. whipple and myself were appointed a committee to visit the capital and confer with officers of the government on the subject. the result was that a bill was prepared with the aid of hon. henry wilson, which was passed by congress and signed by president lincoln. march 3nd. 1865. i remained in washington during the pendency of the bill - as it had to be watched and pushed forward - assisted by an occasional visit from mr. whipple, and the night of its passage was to me one of extreme anxiety. the bill was in the hands of mr. eliot of mass., and he had been on the alert all day for an opportunity to call it up. at 9 o'clock at night the speaker heard his voice and gave him the floor. the question of taking the bill from the table was carried on a call for the yeas and nays by only a single vote in the two-thirds majority required, and the previous question, in the midst of some confusion, at once carried the bill. messrs. sumner and wilson in the senate, with mr. eliot in the house deserve our grateful acknowledgments for their invaluable services. among the trustees mentioned in the act, are william c. bryant, peter cooper, gerrit smith, albert s. barnes, j. w. alvord, william claffin, a. a. low. george l. stearns, abbot lawrence, levi coffin, and forty others, all men eminent for financial ability or moral and literary excellence. these persons and their successors, were constituted a body corporate in the city of washington, in the district of columbia, by the name of the fsb, and by that name may sue and be sued in any court of the united states. in the securing of the charter, the great preliminary and essential step was taken, but very much remained to be done to make it operative: and to demonstrate to the people the practical advantages which must accrue to them from the success of the enterprise. no one could be sanguine enough to suppose that the mere fact that such an organization had been effected would be sufficient to ensure its prosperity and permanence ; that everything could be left to the instinct of the poeple, or to fortuitious circumstances. it was necessary that the subject be presented so simply and so cogently to the people that they would become convinced of its utility and special adaptation to their needs: necessary that their confidence in the beneficent character of the institution and the philanthropic prupose of the men who projected it should be won. besides the assistance guaranteed from the secretaries designated, the company was aided and encouraged in the prosecution of its work by the commissioner of the freedmen's bureau, general o. o. howard. he commended it to the military officers in all the states over which the jurisdiction of the bureau extended: offered every facility for the secretary and his assistants to travel through the south and communicate freely with the people ; and he officially appointed mr. alvord inspector of the financial affairs of the freedmen, with instructions to report to him what frauds may have been practiced upon the colored people, and also the most efficient means of securing their monied interests. the enterprise was now fairly afloat. although there was as yet nothing tangible to exhibit, the grand requisite was attained; the officers were, so to speak, en rapport with the people, and logic and common sense, and the intuitive perception which seldom leads a man to mistake or neglect his own interest, would do the rest. the first branch of the company was formed in washington, the national centre, from which an immense influence might radiate to render the organization of branches in other localities more feasible. the bank was reported to the trustees in june, 1865, as ready to begin operations, and its first deposit $24, was received the 11th of july. after the elapse of three months its aggregate deposits amounted to $4,425. this branch now holds $207,964.95. the operations of the company were further extended by the transfer to them of two other institutions of the nature of banks, but organized only by military authority. soon after the enlistment of colored troops was authorized by the government, general rufus saxton, military governor of south carolina, established at beaufort an institution for receiving the money of the soldiers, subject to their order. under his auspices this institution was of great service to the colored troops. a similar, but smaller, one was formed by general b. f. butler, at norfolk, virginia, about the same time. in july, 1865, the norfolk bank was transferred to the fsb;

indeed, is in itself an educator, almost equal to the schools. the $1,500,000 now on deposit is only the money value of its benefits. the whole civilization and culture of the freedman feel its influence. even the $10,000,000 drawn from us and invested in important purchases, is a matter of congratulation. comforts innumerable have been multiplied. thousands of families arc thereby settled in permanent homes. a detailed statement could be given of what has been done in all directions with the larger part of this immense sum in the permanent improvement of these people. at charleston, s. c.. we have a choice property, well purchased, commodious, and everything properly secured. as owned by themselves, this banking-house has become the pride of the freedmen of charleston. at beaufort we own the office and over 20,000 feet of land. at vicksburg, a fine banking-house was recently purchased. all the banks visited have faithful cashiers, and are thriving, some of them with prospects specially encouraging. macon, a branch recently opened, is a rich center of one of the best portions of the south; $1,000,000 was here, during the autumn and early winter, paid to freedmen for their share of last year's cotton ; a goodly portion of this sum has been deposited. a branch is strongly urged at lexington, ky. in that city i found 12,000 colored people, the most prosperous of any freedmen i have yet seen at the south. they generally own their own homes - three rooms, if of one story - and one hundred or more are of two stories. they are taxed on $250,000 of real estate, and are the well-paid cartmen, carriage drivers, and mechanics of the city. general g. s. goodloe, (a relative of henry clay,) wealthy and influential, introduced me to a number of similar gentlemen, all strong friends of our work. they made many inquiries, and desire our documents. i saw also leading colored men, who have heard well of our banks, and wish one in lexington. kentucky is full of ku-klux, who are specially roused by the fifteenth amendment; but the above men say a bank in lexington will be safe. these are a few illustrations of the general prosperity of this institution ; and yet i found the field around all our branches not half canvassed or cultivated. out-door work is everywhere called for, and the people should be constantly aroused and instructed on the subject. how best to do this is an important question. it occurs to me that, with increasing business, we shall at each branch respectively, though at different times, reach the point when the cashier will need a competent assistant, properly bonded. the cashier could then be out addressing the people, or visiting the surrounding rural population ; and thus, in my judgment, secure increased deposits more than sufficient to defray the added expense. as it is, however, the immediate prospect of a general increase of deposits, especially in the cotton regions, is very suspicious. although many are poor, the south is full of money from the large and high-priced crop, a good share of which is to go into the hands of colored men. in conclusion, permit me to say that no one can visit our branch institutions - note their progress, freedom hitherto from losses, increasing patronage and popularity - without astonishment. this institution has been the child of a protecting providence. if local committees are well chosen, cashiers of ability properly bonded and inspected, accounting in weekly reports accurately with our exchanges through the national banks and banking houses of our friends jay cooke & co., the system we have adopted seems as safe as anything of the kind of human affairs can be. the interest, also, which we allow depositors (all we can possibly make) will undoubtedly be increased by this advancing prosperity ; though the solid character of our government investments already make our triannual dividends, so far as i could learn, very satisfactory. j. w. alvord, president.

there depositors are most numerous, and the aggregate of savings the largest. thus - in massachusetts, at the date of the latest report to the legislature, there were in the state, 108 savings banks: 350,000 depositors, and $80,431,583. in the little state of rhode island, 25 banks ;

as a great conservator of the well-being of the poor: as a perpetual invitation in each city, town, and village to youth an 1 health to put safely by something against the day of old age and sickness, is just beginning to find a footing south of the potomac. until the close of the late war there was no civilized labor in the south. the employer was at the same time the owner of the laboring man. what inducement was there for the toiler to put by his money? what money of his own had he to put by? with the earnest desire to place within reach of the disenthralled race the opportunity and incentive to careful savings and safe keeping of small earnings, at the close of the war, congress granted a charter to a company called the fsb, with authority to establish, in any one of our states, savings banks for the safe keeping and investment in the stocks, bonds, and treasury notes of the united states the savings of the colored people. one of the last acts of the lamented president lincoln was to affix his signature to the charter giving legal existence to this company. this was in march, 1865. let us now show, in a few words, what has been done by this company in the space of less than five years: in that comparatively short time, banks for savings have been established in augusta, macon, and savannah, georgia; in beaufort and charleston, south carolina; in jacksonville and tallahassee, florida ; in mobile and huntsville, alabama: in new orleans, louisiana ; in vicksburg, mississippi ; in chattanooga, memphis, and nashville, tennessee ; in louisville, kentucky ; in st. louis, missouri ; in martinsburg, richmond, and norfolk, virginia ; in raleigh, wilmington, and newbern, north carolina ; and in washington, baltimore, and new york, with a parent or principal office in washington. beginning with nothing, of course, in the midst of a people just escaped from the shackles of slavery, at the end of one year from the date of its charter, to wit, on the 1st day of march, 1866, deposits were - $305,167 24 \u2013 march 1867 deposits were 1,624,853 33, march 1868 deposits were - 3,582,378 36 march 1869 - 7,257,798 63 and to-day the aggregate of all the deposits is over ten millions! of course there have been constant and heavy drafts from these aggregates. depositors, when they have accumulated a few hundred dollars in the bank, quite naturally desire to buy a piece of land, or to enter upon some mercantile or mechanical pursuit. so they draw out money which, but for the bank, would probably never have been saved, and invest as they see opportunity. a population of small land-owners, traders, and mechanics - the very element of a true democratic civilization is appearing on the once lordly domains of the planter. the former chattel, thrown upon his own resources, is called, by the necessities of his position, to look out for to-morrow. so he needs his earnings from time to time. the drafts, for the period above specified, were as follows: year ending march 1, 1867, - $1,225,928 16, year ending march 1, 1868 - 2,944,079 36, year ending march 1, 1869 - 6,184,368 71. at the last date, the net deposit remaining in the bank, invested in united states securities or in cash and office property, was $1,073,429 92. on the 31st of october, the date of the latest published report, this deposit had reached $1,340,133 94. it will probably have reached  two millions within the next year. these savings, as fast as accumulated, are loaned to the united states, i e, invested in their bonds and stocks. the company has paid up to november, 1st, 1869, regularly to its depositors interest at the rate of 5 per cent, in triennial instalments, which, on being entered on the depositor's book as a new deposit, gives him really 1 2\/3 percent, each four months, compounded three times per annum. in connection with the other work of the bank, it issues monthly, - for gratuitous distribution, to stimulate its patrons to habits of temperance, thrift, and frugality - a newspaper, which is sought for eagerly. we may add that we find this bank to be established on the mutual principle. each depositor is a stockholder to the amount of his deposits. after paying, out of its income, the expenses of the business of the institution, the balance of its profits are distributed to its depositors every four months. the larger the amount of its deposits the greater the advantage to the stockholder, i e to the depositor. every man. woman, or child, who is able to deposit $5 in this bank is a stockholder to that amount, and receives his or her share of the profits which may accrue from the successful management of its business. your committee have to report that the opposition among the white people of the south to the progress of these banks is disappearing ; that the security and safety of the bank is now thoroughly established ; that it has purchased, in the city of washington, a property directly opposite the united states treasury, where it will build a convenient banking-house in the coming year ; that the best friends of the colored people are the friends and patrons of this bank. major general o. o. howard calls it \"the best educator in the field.\" among the names of its trustees are found those of henry d. cooke, esq., of the house of jay cooke & co. ; hon. j. m., brodhead, of the united states treasury ; gen. b. w. brice. paymaster general, u. s. army; bishop s. talbot, of the m. e. church, and others well known throughout the land. but, though the deposits have reached one and a half millions of dollars, your committee i think that such amount but poorly represents the savings of the colored people within reach of the influence of this company. there are within easy reach of its 25 bank 300.000 laboring people of color. if each had only $10 in the bank the aggregate would be three millions - more than double the sum now on deposit in them. or if, out of the three hundred thousand people referred to above, the same proportion were depositors as are found among the laboring people of rhode island, we would have 100,000 depositors and $2,660,000. in conclusion, your committee would report the following resolutions: resolved, that, as an aid to the laboring man, affording a safe and profitable place of investment for his small savings, we commend the national fsb.\nresolved, that we are of the opinion that in all the principal cities of the south the colored people should unite in establishing these savings banks, which we believe to be an incentive to the economy, as well as a proper place for keeping its fruits. william j. wilson, f. g. barbadoes, abram smith, j. m. turner, james harris, committee."},{"identifier":1870102701208.0,"Newspaper":"New National Era","Bank":"FSB","Year":1870,"Month":10,"Day":27.0,"Title":"our new banking house","Text":"the new building projected last spring for our fine and commanding lot on pennsylvania avenue opposite the treasury department, is already rising above the ground. a broad and massive superstructure has been laid, well fitted to support the substantial walls that are to be placed thereon. the work will be pushed on with all despatch to the earliest completion. the directors have had urgent applications for every room that can possibly be spared after the bank is moved there. it is by no means certain that we shall not use these banking rooms for our central office and continue the washington branch at its present eligible location. such a plan could not affect our system of management, and there are so many evident advantages from the arrangement that it is very probable it will be carried out.

it became the law of the land, and general palmer reported that in kentucky alone more than twenty thousand slaves were made free by it. mr. wilson introduced a bill, which became the law, making the wives and children of colored soldiers free, and general palmer, then commanding the united states forces in kentucky, in an official report, made six months after the passage of that act, estimated that seventy-five thousands women and children were made free by it. thens of thousands of the wives and children of such soldiers in the states of delaware, maryland, west virginia, kentucky, tennessee, and missouri were thus made free under mr. wilson son's four measures. the act abolishing slavery in the district of columbia ; the act making colored persons received into the military service, their mothers, wives, and children, if owned by rebels, free ; the making all slaves free when mustered into the military service ; and the act making their wives and children free, emancipated not less than a quarter of a million of slaves in the border states. mr. wilson introduced into the appropriation bill of 1864 a section providing that all persons of color who had been, or who might be, mustered into the military service, should receive the same uniform, clothing, arms, equipments, rations, medical attendance, and pay as white soldiers. he reported from the committee of conference, to which has been referred the bill in relation to the freedman's bureau, and entirely new bill, to establish in the war department a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, which became a law, under which that beneficent instrumentality the freedman's bureau was organized. on mr. wilson's motion the provision was adopted that the lands sold for taxes in south carolina should be divided into lots of forty acres each and sold at low rates ; under which act many freedmen obtained homesteads. mr. wilson introduced the bill that abolished peonage in new mexico, the provision striking the word \u00ab white \u00bb from the militia laws, and also the measure that prohibited the punishment by whipping in the unreconstructed states. mr. wilson introduced in 1863 a bill, which became a law, incorporating \u00ab an institution for the education of colored youth in the district of columbia \u00bb ; the act \u00ab incorporating the howard university \u00bb ; and also the act \u00ab to incorporate the national fsb \u00bb. mr. wilson also introduced many other measures in relation to slavery and the rights of persons of color, either as independent measures or as amendments to measures introduced by others.

","Text":"treasury department, third auditor's office, washington, jan. 22, 1874. i desire, sir, to say through your journal and every other accessible medium, of whatever political shade, interested in the material development of our section, that while i am in favor of the fsb as a savings institution, we can never expect to see our city become a money-circulating centre for the south, nor important as a wholesale, business and trading metropolis, so long as we are indifferent as to where the monies, the result of the thrift and energy of its tradesmen and manual laboring people, are sent and circulated. our money must be kept at home and put to work among the people of whom it is earned, unless there is no demand for its use, with as good percentage and security as it will get abroad. true political economy teaches that we are not only to be careful how we spend our money, but we are to spend it intelligently, with reference to the need of others as well as ourselves, knowing the exact channel through which it passes, even when hypothecated in any manner of trade above its face value in scrip or coin, in order that a pro rato benefit may accrue to the spender and the entire business community. the town is continually being drained of every dollar expended in meeting the ordinary expenses for comfort and labor, and this is the most active circulating capital in any city. the money earned and saved can find a healthy circulating level in business, or loans, negotiated easier, and with less expense to borrower and lender at home, where it is earned, and with more profit to the community and all parties concerned, than it can get abroad. the whole money-saving scheme instituted for the good of our people in the south, is conducted on a plan that stagnates the financial atmosphere of the money-spending, and manual laboring class. the passage of money from one hand to another, in small circle of business men, one or two hours sooner or later, and owned by each other for each other, but a few hours, makes or saves a man from becoming a bankrupt; and by a few hours' misconnection in money matters, may embarrass the entire business community. now, what i with to say is this: if a few hours stagnation in the active funds of a community, can thus embarrass the business of a town what must be the effect when it is gathered up by the smalls in a savings bank, and sent away to work in the interest of those in other communities, making business for hundreds of working men, and borrowed for this active service by men who can no better affort to borrow, and who can pay no more for its use than the capitalist of our own city. when a bank is established in our community, it is presumed that, like other banking houses belonging to the place, it is established for the benefit of the people residing there, by loaning and taking care of the funds in the interest of the depositors and the community. money can be borrowed by citizens, but the loan is negotiated at an enormous expense to both parties and it is not the policy of the washington bank to grand loans through the branch banks, while here your money is loaned every day, and with personal advantage if necessary to the officers negotiating the loan: but those who create the capital, where the banks are located, are not allowed to loan nor borrow through the branch officers. why not allow all the funds deposited at a certain point to remain there as a trading capital for the benefit of the branch, the depositors and the people? why seek a borrower abroad when we have them here with a [?] of freedom who know the people better? ask the main bank to allow us to keep our own money and empower the directors and our efficient cashier of the branch to negotiate loans with good collaterals. the washington bank has a lien on more property than any other banking house in washington, with great profit to itself and every business interest in the community. what good does investment do our people? any one can this see the damaging results of the system. if the charter will not allow any change, let the colored people of the south ask congress through their representative to so amend the charter as to give less advantage to one quarter and a more equal change among the depositors where the branch is located, and especially where the cashier is capable of negotiating a loan with good security. the managers tell our colored business men in the south desiring this accommodation through their own branch, such as they can, and do get of other banks in southern communities, that they \u00ab do not loan money, and that it would be very unsafe to accommodate the colored capitalist and business men south by investment with them, and yet colored men and more white men are accommodated here. they say money will go of itself where it is in best demand in its best interest. how can this money get a demand at home when it is legislated away by the washington bank in order to accommodate the bank and people of washington. this sort of argument has worn threadbare, and is only true when made in the interest of those who make it. the statement is a superstitious one, and if made against business white men in the south, it is an appeal to the political prejudices of the negro, against his best interest; if it is made against colored men in the south, who will compare with colored men elsewhere, it is a sad reflection, on their integrity, when compared with both white and colored who are accomodated in the washington bank. i say this in the best interest of \u00ab the southern branches, it cry \u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0mad dog \u00bb by saying a negro is opposed to the bank, would be to me the best evidence that i am correct.

\u00bb. i have taken a great deal of time to investigate the subject, and have in every case, where the answer came from an able bodied man, been able to disprove his assertion. i have seen men live comfortably on $300 per year and keep out of debt. i have seen their income suddenly increased to $600, or perhaps $1000, and at the end of the year they would be just as poor as when receiving $300. now, any man can figure on this, and is ready to exclaim with me, \u00ab why, if he can live on $300, don't he save the balance? \u00bb. now, that is the idea i want to get you to adopt and follow out. it is a simple sum in arithmetic. in most cases the increased pay goes into extravagances and luxuries which are more injury than good. looking at it from one point of view, the man whose receipts are thus increased is not one cent better off ; he has only been able to disburse a little more money, which has passed through his hands, doing him no more benefit than the money of a bank or other corporation does the cashier through whose hands it passes. it is hard to begin. i know how longignly a poor man looks forward to the luxury of indulgence in something his means has not heretofore allowed him. i know how hopefully every mother looks forward to the time when she may vie with her neighbors in the dress and adornment of her children ; so, when a little addition to the income arrives, it is already mentally spent. this is all wrong. instead of these extravagant outlays, this money, and every cent possible from every other source, should not be saved, put at interest and become a permanent blessing. the time comes in every man's and woman's life when the follies of fashion end, and the sober realities of life are everywhere about them. then what a comfort will it be to know that we denied ourselves and saved by it a home and comfort. one of the first questions asked by a person who wishes to put their money in a bank is: \u00ab is it safe? \u00bb. i have no doubt many of you have heard the question asked in regard to our bank. i am glad of this public opportunity to answer it. i believe you will be satisfied that i tell you the truth - and i tell you that it is safe. safe as the government of the united states, in whose bonds all the surplus is invested. the branch here, and all the branches everywhere, are responsible for their deposits. they have now a considerable surplus - i think could pay every dollar due to depositors and have nearly one hundred thousand dollars left. it is managed by upright men ; men of the highest character, and of national reputation. if a bank was robbed or destroyed, your money would still he safe. if a few years more shall roll round and our bank shall not have prospered to the extent of treble its present amount of deposits, then i shall have to acknowledge that i am disappointed, and that the colored people are not prospering as they ought. i am sure there are some within my hearing who have been benefitted by this bank. numbers of houses and homes have been secured by those who, for a few months, have saved their few dollars every week. i appeal to them to come up and help us. every man, woman, and child can do something in the way of explaining, urging, talking, and acting. do it, my friends ; work with energy and will. it is one of the best works you ever engaged in \u00bb.

and while being attractive in appearance, possesses the essential qualities of being substantial and in every respect suitable for the purpose intended. the cashier's room is the first entered, and is a fine one, admirably adapted for the transaction of a large business. a beautiful solid marble counter, paneled and moulded, extends along the entire lenght. this is surmounted by black walnut desks, guarded by railings of the same material, behind which stands the cashier and his assistants. beyond this room is the office of the actuary and his clerks, and within it is the vault for the valuables. this is protected by a massive metal door, which is secured by a ponderous combination lock. within the vault is an immense safe, constructed to resist fire and burglars. these are from the manufactory of the american steam safe company, of baltimore, and have been furnished by their agent, j. c. parker, of seventh street. the inside apartment is for the use of the board of trustees, and is a very fine room. the three rooms have been hand-somely frescoed by shutter, and are neatly and comfortably furnished and carpeted. the entire building has been constructed adn the arrangements completed, by mr. robert fleming, the contractor, who is entitled to much credit for the manner in which the work has been done. a short sketch of the history of this institution, which has grown from a very small beginning until it has attained its present marvelous proportions, may not be uninteresting. early in 1865 a charter of incorporation was obtained from congress, and on the 11th of july in that year rev. j. w. alvord, on the part of the trustees, commissioned mr. william j. wilson, the present cashier, to undertake the work of making the bank known to the colored people of this city and the freedmen of the surrounding localities. mr. wilson was then engaged teaching school, on twelfth street, near r., but notwithstanding there was then no compensation attached to the office, he cheerfully undertook the duty assigned to him. his first office was a rented room in the upper part of a detached brick house on g street, opposite the foundry church. he remained there until the following spring, laboring against much distrust and prejudice in this endeavors to ompress upon his own people the advantages of the project. his first announcement of it was to his own pupils, and one of them, a son of a freedman named hill, told him his father's box had been broken open the previous night and some two hundred dollars carried off. the boy said his father still twenty-four dollars, and asked mr. wilson if he would put that in his bank. the answer being in the affirmative, the father was brought back after school recess and made the first deposit of $24, and so the freedman hill laid the foundation of an institution which struck deep root in the soil, and whose branches now spread over a large portion of the union. a strange oart of the history of that deposit is, that it still remains accumulating, and nothing is known of its owner's fate. the second depositor was the wife of rev. dr. garrett, pastor of the fifteenth street presbyterian colored church ; and the third, mr. walker lewis, now one of the trustees, and the owner of a large, amount of real estate in this city, which he has accumulated by prudent investments. both these made their deposits to show they had confidence in the project and to inspire it in others. during the infancy of the institution mr. wilson carried the funds of it on his person, and he did not find the load a difficult one to transport. he labored on despite of every difficulty, and with the countenance of the eminent men who obtained the charter, determined to make the enterprise a success. in the spring of 1866 a basement room in the house occupied by the freedmen's bureau, at the corner of nineteenth and 1 streets, was assigned as the office of the bank, and there the work was carried on until about the same time in the following year, when it was moved to the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street. during this time every effort was used to induce the colored soldiers to deposit something of their pay, and many did so who now reap the benefit of their produce in the ownership of their dwellings. in the winter of 1867 the next move of the bank was to the house of mrs. sullivan, on seventh street, between e and f, where two rooms were rented and occupied for about fourteen months, when another change of base was made to may's building, which has just been vacated. in these years of struggle there was much of interesting incident in the endeavor to establish the bank. a detailed history of this would fill volumes. confidence in savings institutes is a thing of slow growth among all peoples, and it was perculiarly so of the colored race. they were unused to the thing, and those who were foremost in advocating this one were strangers to them, and were in a great measure looked upon with distrust. there were large numbers of colored troops being brought here and quartered in the vicinity. it was considered that they might be induced to save a portion of their pay, and mr. wilson, being one of the representative men of his race, went among them in their camps on pay days and explained the benefits of the institution to them. this was attended with varied results until the first district colored regiment was mustered out, when he succeeded in getting deposits from them amounting to nearly five thousand dollars. he remained in a tent all night with this amount in his breast, but did not sleep much, through anxiety, although having a guard of soldiers to protect him. he carried his treasure safely into town, but for many days some doubting thomases would come along and demand back their money, which, of course, they got ; but some, in their suspicion, called for it at the point of the pistol. a kentucky colored regiment was stationed near this city for about a year, and many of them made regular deposits with the cashier when he paid his regular visits on pay day. a number of these carried away, on leaving, sufficient to purchase homes for themselves. the second district, on its return from texas, and the fourth maryland, which was stationed here for a time, and others, were largely benefited in the same way. in addition to his work among the soldiers, mr. wilson paid several visits to different localities in maryland and virginia, where he met with great success, particularly in richmond and on a farm of general forrest's known as the sandgates, near port tobacco, maryland, where large numbers of laborers were employed. the present extensive, ramifications of the bank by branches throughout the south and southwest, where they have fine buildings and do a large business, are so well known that it is unnecessary to go into particulars, but attention may be again called to the small seed sown by the freedman hill in the shape of his $24 deposit, from which such large fruit has grown, to gather a moral that may be worth pondering on. the depositors now doing business number from 150 to 200, and the daily amount of business transacted varies from six to twenty thousand dollars. the deposits in four weeks have exceeded the drafts by as much as $60,000, and no discounts are made for the public or any officer of the bank. advances are made only on security of real estate.

","Text":"every visitor to washington inquires about the handsome stone edifice which stands on pennsylvania avenue opposite the north end of the treasury building. its dimensions and appearance indicate a public purpose, and the general inference is that it is a government building. the upper part of it is devoted to government purposes, being occupied by the law department and the signal service bureaus, where they have a degree of comfort not shared by other public functionaries because of the superior height of the ceilings over those of the government buildings, which are all comparatively low. this is the fsb's banking house ; being, in fact, but a wing of the entire structure as it is ultimately intended to be built, and occupying the finest and most conspicuous site in washington. it is quite equal in appearance and completeness of detail to any building in the united states devoted to like purposes, and is a monument to the thrift and energy of the colored race. actively moving about in this building may be seen a white-haired gentleman, whose quickness of movement and nervous energy belong to the period of life's greatest vigor. this is john watson alvord, a. m., the president of the fsb, an institution so young that knowledge of its existence is by no means universal, and many learn of it for the first time when they see its central business house, and hear with surprise that it has handled over thirty millions of dollars in the few years which have passed since the close of the rebellion. practical facts like these seize hold of the mind of our money-loving people, and at once they manifest an interest in the history of that which is so solidly respectable. that history is a short one, and soon told, being, in fact, but an illustration of the quick perception and organizing power of its president. the gentlemen we have spoken of is the father of the fsb, over whose destinies he now presides. its organization is only an incident in his long life of usefulness and strange adventure as you may readily perceive. there is a peculiar admixture of placidity of surface and interior action apparent in his manner and movements. he seems like one whose enthusiasms have been repressed in a school of necessity - who has had to hold a tight rein all his life on the spirit that dwells within him. his eye bright and restless will beam sympathetic light at what you say when his lips make no answer. the blood, too, comes and goes in his face while you address him, showing that his heart responds while his tongue is silent. at once you conclude that president alvord has a history and want to know it. i have looked into it a little and find that he was born in connecticut something less than sixty-five years ago ; that he was educated in the public schools of that state until seventeen years of age, when, with yankee precocity, he went to school-teaching himself. after a few years of this, he became confidendial clerk of a large wholesale business house, and afterward went to savannah, georgia, where his mercantile work was successful ; but on his return home he studled for the ministry, working his way first through the manual labor school, near utica, new york, and helping to support himself by teaching in vacation a select school in that city ; engaged, also, meanwhile as agent of the american sunday school union in lecturing through herkimer and other counties, establishing sabbath schools and libraries. the year 1833 found him pursuing his studies at lane seminary, ohio, under the presidency of rev. lyman beecher, d. d., where, in the fall of 1834, he took part in the rebellion of students who had been prohibited the discussion of the slavery question. with fifty others he left the seminary, and with twenty of whom formed an association for study under the patronage of dr. gamaliel bailey, arthur tappan, and others ; and while thus engaged took the superintendence of colored schools in cincinnati, six in number, although prejudice was so strong as to exclude him from all white society. after a year or two of such service, having made a perilous lecturing tour beset by mobs, through northern ohio for the anti-slavery society, mr. alvord united with his old classmates at oberlin, and graduated in the first class from that institution. he never lost the opportunity of assisting fugitive slaves, and was subjected to all the indignities which devoted service to a down-trodden race brought upon its friends in those early days of abolition. this kind of treatment, strenghtened his devotion to the african race, and, despairing of immediate emancipation, he determined to go to africa as a missionary. to prepare himself for this field of labor, he went to new york and entered upon the study of medicine ; but before the close of his term was attacked with an illness which nearly proved fatal, and laid him up in ordinary for several years, part of the time being spent at st. augustine, florida. this was during the semi-nole war, and mr. a. availed himself of his opportunity to become conversant with the instituion of slavery practically, and observe its effects upon both master and servant, as well as upon this devoted indian tribe. from 1841 to 1845 he was associated pastor of a congregational church at stamford, connecticut, and in 1846 took charge of the phillip's church in boston, massachusetts, where with success he remained till 1851 ; when, his health again failing, he left for europe, and traveled extensively in russia, a country at that time but little known to americans. here, at kamini ostroff, a beautiful suburb of st. petersburg, mr. alvord was the guest of the grand duke of oldenburg, and enjoyed many opportunities of studying the society and institutions of the russian empire. during his absence he also traveled in germany, france, england, and scotland, and with apparently restored health returned to his old pastorate and resumed his duties. a few months' service, however, revealed to him the necessity of discontinuing that kind of labor ; and, very much to the regret of his congregation, sought release from his charge, which he obtained in 1852. he then, after protracted discussion on the question of antislavery publications, became secretary of the american tract society, boston, for several years, and when the rebellion broke out, came to washington to superintend the circulation of books and papers among the union soldiers. this work grew upon his hands, and he followed the army into the field in the spring of 1862, leaving assistants in washington to forward to him reading matter and hospital stores. of the latter alone he distributed more than forty tons, gratuitously furnished for sick and wounded soldiers. his frequent letters from amidst those thrilling events were widely circulated. battle-fields and hospitals became for five years the familiar scenes of his labors, which were anterior to, and the precursors of the sanitary and christian commissions, with both of which he cooperated to the end of the war. on the entrance of general sherman to savannah, he went there and commenced the first educational efforts for freedmen in georgia ; five hundred of whom were at once gathered as pupils, and marched through the streets to buildings (bryan's slave mart and oglethorpe university) assigned them by post commander geary. he was afterward \u00ab inspector of schools and finances \u00bb under general howard, and then during four-and-a-half-years \u00ab\u00a0general superintendent of schools for freedmen \u00bb throughout all the states lately in rebellion. his ten semi-annual reports giving the statistics and results of this work were printed by the freedmen's bureau. in the autumn of 1864 mr. alvord proposed to gentlemen in new york the institution of a national savings bank for freedmen, and in the winter of 1864-65', by their aid and the earnest assistance of senators sumner and wilson, and mr. eliot of the house, he secured the passage of an act of congress chartering the fsb, which was signed by abraham lincoln on the 3d of april, 1865, being one of his last autographs. on the 4th of april, 1865, the corporators met and elected william a. booth president and j. w. alvord corresponding secretary, directing the latter to organize branches throughout the southern states, which he proceeded forthwith to do. the first place of business selected for the principal office was no. 87 cedar street, new york ; and the first branch established was at norfolk, virginia, on the 3d day of june, 1865. on the 11th of july, 1865, the first deposit was made at washington, d. c., and on the first day of august following a branch was opened here. the branch at louisville was organized on the 1st of september, 1865, that at richmond october 13th. the military bank at beaufort, south carolina, became a branch of this institution october 16th ; fifteen branches in all having been opened by the end of the fiscal year, march, 1866. in 1867 the meetings of the board of trustees were transferred from new york to washington, and this was made the principal office of the company, occupying first the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street, afterward the building on seventh street, opposite the general post office, until december 7, 1871, when the company removed, with its washington branch, to the spacious building located on president square. mr. booth was succeeded in the presidency by mahlon t. hewitt, esq., who served till 1868, with mr. alvord as first vice president. on the 12th of march, 1868, mr. alvord was elected president, and has held that position ever since. for the past three years he has devoted himself exclusively to the interests of the institution which was founded by him and over which he presides. it is a signal success, and one of which he, with his condjuctors and assistants, may well be proud. it has thirty-three branches, and its total deposits have amounted to the handsome aggregate of over $31,000,000, ($12,000,000 of this during the last year) while the balance on hand due depositors is about $3,700,000. mr. alvord's degree of a. m. was confered upon him by yale college, and has been honored by the hard labors of a well-spent life. he exhibits the same determined purpose, untiring energy, and business shrewdness in the management of a financial institution which have characterized him in other pursuits, and is a practical illustration of the readiness with which americans adapt themselves to the requirements of a varied life. at the annual election held on thursday last the trustees of the fsb showed their continued appreciation of the services of mr. alvord by re-electing him president for the ensuing year.

[...] economy. - by economy we mean a judicious arrangement of human affairs, as opposed to proffigacy, which is human action in want on riot. if we would watch dame nature we would find ample lessons of economy. there is nothing lost ; but simply transmuted. and now i have briefly introduced these three subjects, i will endeavor to apply them. i ask the attention of the laboring colored man especially to acquire these three important things as the earnest means to elevation, and independence among his fellow men. in some cases men must begin with the last, economy, and proceed to education. such i deem the need of the adult. and how can this be done? i can conceive of no better plan than husbanding your earnings. take care of the penny and the pound will take care of itself. and when temptations be set your forward your money to one of the branches of the national fsb. in this city we are doing a great and manifold work. at the head of affairs we have an honest, upright and loving friend of our race, mr. alvord. next in order and most essential is our actuary, w. stickney, the friend of the young man. he is the right man, and in the right place, and not only is he efficient, but his manners are the strenght and life of the institution. nor are we, once oppressed, and denied of all advantages, doing otherwise than well. we are growing such as messrs. george johnson and w. t. tomkins, shining lights in our city, young men whose efficiency promise a great future. we have also our rising young lawyers in this institution, messrs. c. thomas and j. h. cook. this latter gentleman has done faithful service in howard university as chief clerk in the bureau of refugees, etc., etc., and is now one of the trustees. i mention these particulars to show our friends in the south that \u00ab we are about a great work \u00bb, the purpose of which is elevation and progress. but i cannot fail to mention an invaluable agent in all the success which the bank has achieved, namely prof. w. j. wilson. this man gave birth to the great thought - a fsb - when others were slumbering, and knew not by what means the new freedman may become a man indeed, and we are surprised to find that after toil and efficiency mr. wilson is today but cashier of the fsb. if the bank is a success it is but the exponent of the success of the freedmen, and he should share largely in its fortunes. d. a. s.

three of which are located in this state  the wilmington, newbern and raleigh. total amount deposited in all the branches up to the 1st of september, 1870 : $15,990,661.18. total amount of drafts for the same period : $13,949,590.83. leaving a balance due depositors of : $2,041.35. total amount deposited in the raleigh branch during the month of september: $5,062.04. total amount of drafts for same period: $6,504.04. total amount of drafts for same period: $6,504.53. it will be seen that the drafts for the month exceed the deposits some $1,442.49, which is mainly due to the fact that many persons who had been depositing ever since the commencement of the good work up to that time had amassed a sufficient amount of cash to enable them to purchase comfortable homes, and otherwise provide themselves with the necessaries of life. total amount deposited in raleigh branch: $95,171.97. total drafts: $80,186.79. leaving a balance due depositors: $14,985.18. the number of depositors to which this amount is due, 778. this, mr. editor, speaks well for the colored people of this city, numbering something over 3,000. this branch went into operation april, 1868, if we mistake not, which, taking all things into consideration, show, according to the above figures, that this branch has done more business than many of the older branches, and as much as any of the twenty-nine. much credit is due the cashier, mr. brodie, for this grand result. but for his untiring efforts in creating confidence in the bank, and inducing the people to deposit, much of the $14,000 now safely invested in government securities would have been hidden in the earth, or chincked away in some obscure corner of the house, and much, very much, of it would have been foolishly spent. we believe no one could have worked with greater success among our people than mr. brodie has. ever since his advent among us he has devoted himself almost wholly to the moral, intellectual, and industrial advancement of his race. his work is to be seen and felt for miles around. not having participated to any great extent in politics, he has grown in favor with all classes, both white and black ; and today no man stands, higher in the estimation of the people of raleigh than george washington brodie.

","Text":"we take the following from \u00ab anecdotes of public men \u00ab, by j. w. forney, published in the sunday chronicle: \u00ab\u00a0after riding along pennsylvania avenue and observing the new residences going up in every quarter, and the broad streets laid with enduring composite, we stopped on the noble walk before the north front of the treasury department and stood opposite the fsb. its history will form a striking chapter in the annals of these times. on the east corner of the same block i pointed out the famous banking house of corcoran & riggs - now managed, i believe, by george w. riggs. the contrast between these two edifices is a contrast between two ideas and suggests a moral better than an argument. let us take two living men - men whose names are immediately associated with these institutions - w. w. corcoran, the head of the little old banking house at the corner, and william j. wilson, cashier of the new savings bank - the one white and the other colored, both natives of the united states, and both sympathizers with the south in the rebellion - corcoran with the confederates and wilson with the slaves. it can be no offence to the white man to say that, like his colored brother, he was of humble origin, and it is equally true that while he flourished under our institutions william j. wilson was oppressed and degraded. the white man grow in riches and in graces with his years. under former administration's, before the sub-treasury, he was the principal depositary of the national funds, and to this day his name is a letter of credit in all financial circles. belonging to the age that is fast passing away, he does not forget that most of his wealth is the result of the confidence of his government ; and in the rapid growth of washington, althouth he himself has resisted many of the recent efforts in that direction, there are no more beautiful objects than his noble art gallery and the louisa home for indigent ladies. the black man had none of these chances. when congress, early in 1865, passed a charter of incorporation for the fsb, w. j. wilson, the present indomitable cashier, was engaged teaching school on twelfth street, near r., in washington city, without remuneration. the trustees called upon him to make the bank known to the colored people of america, and he undertook the work. his first office was a rented room in a small brick house on g street, where he remained for a few months stemming the tide of bigotry against his race, and untiring in teaching them the necessity of hoarding the surplus wages at some institution that would keep them safe and profitably. a freedman in 1866 told wilson that his father's box had been broken into and two hundred stolen, but that the old man had still twenty-four dollars left, and this was the first investment, under wilson's advice, in the fsb. it was the seed from which has grown what is already a gigantic and must become an overwhelming corporation. other deposits followed in rapid succession, real estate was purchased at the corner of nineteenth and 1 streets, in washington. the operations of the concern became too large in a short time, and it was finally moved to the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street. during this period colored soldiers began to deposit something of their pay, and those who were wise enough to do so now reap the benefit of their wisdom. in the winter of 1867 the bank was moved, to seventh street, between e and f, where it remained for fourtee months, until finally it was located in the new building opposite the treasury department to which i have referred. there are few banking houses in america equal to it, and yet, large, commodious, and beautiful as it is, it is to be still further extended, inasmuch as the company has purchased the whole of the western portion of the lot, and are even now ambitious to buy out corcoran & riggs, so that the entire square may be given up to them. it may be called a tree of many branches, extending through the south and southwest. they have fine buildings, with capable officiers engaged in the good work of collecting the savings for the freedmen, and so hoarding and investing them that in the course of time the institution. will be second to none on the continent. the washington depositors are from one hundred and fifty to two hundred a day, and the daily amount of business varies from six to twenty thousand dollars. in four weeks these deposits have exceeded the drafts by sixty thousand dollars. no discounts are made for the public or for any of the officers of the bank, and advances are made only on security of real estate. it is unnecessary to give further details. the concern itself stands first among financial institutions. its future may be judged from its present. with ordinary care and integrity it must distance all competitors, inasmuch as it has accured the confidence of the great race which, united for one object, can accomplish almost anything. imagine these millions of colored men, women, and children, all resolved upon hoarding up their earnings in one banking institution, and then contrast this unity of action with the savings banks in other cities and states which have grown rich because they have been preferred by only a portion of the whites, and you have the story in a nutshell. the architect of all this property is william j. wilson, the cashier, an earnest, hard-headed, true-hearted man, with the intelligence, the vigor, and the directness of a john w. garrett or a george law, and the conviction of an oliver cromwell. as a pennsylvanian, i am proud to record the fact that, perhaps, the most efficient and persevering of the coadjutors of mr. wilson in the administration of the affairs of this magnificent institution is colonel d. l. eaton, of pittsburg. but wilson is, in fact, the w. w. corcoran of the colored men of the south, successfully emerging grom a deadlier struggle, fighting against sterner obstacles, and perhaps surer of a grander future. who knows but that in the years that lie beyond, a reputation as pure, a credit as high, may await the posterity of the colored banker as that which has a thousand times awarded the white capitalist? i said at the beginning that christmas is that holiday in which childhood looks joyously forward, and when manhood solemnly looks backward, and, as i conclude this striking contrast, may not both child and man be instructed by its lessons, and alike anticipate the glorious destiny of our

$50 for $5. i have known freedmen, after selling their cotton and buying everything they could think of, to throw down a $50 bill and ask what they could get for it. his fear was that some man would eat his throat if he knew he had it. the money is here, and is plentifully made, but it will take labor to save it. the bank is opposed with intense earnestness and bitterness, and will have to endure the sieges of a regular campaign before it will win. i have been greatly encouraged by many examples of industry and sacrifice on the part of the colored people to lift themselves above their evil surroundings. for their encouragement, i wish to publish in the era, from time to time, some of these notable eases, doubting not but others may be inspired with such examples of industry and sacrifice. the lady with whom i am boarding, mrs. coursey, (freed by the war) has by her own unassisted industry and economy bought and paid for a home worth $3,000. \u00ab uncle charley \u00bb is a noble old hero. he came down the street the other day driving a good team, and when in front of the bank the following conversation ensued: \u00ab gentlemen, mules cost money, and my wood must sell for money. i bought these mules to farm with when i hadn't bread in the house \u00bb. i looked at him, and he repeated it with emphasis, cracked his whip, and drove on. i thought of the noble spirit of that man, and that to such men we owe a debt of gratitude for their bright examples of the success and enterprise of our race. mr. cole, one of our business men, married three years ago. he gave to his wife a mexican dollar, and said: \u00ab wife, this is all i have got. keep this and see what we can add to it \u00bb. today this couple own ten acres of good land, and all the implements and stock with which to farm. milly gaines, a widow, paying house-rent, and supporting five children, is one of our regular depositors. while orthers are doubting the bank and wasting money, these are saving their money, and now are decidedly on the winning side of life. doubtless this will be true to too great an extent till the great disparity between the two classes shall be revealed, as it will be in the course of one, three, or five years. our best men will gather round the bank as their strongest hope, and the main contest will be at the beginning. let our people everywhere be encouraged, by these and other examples numerous enough, to be industrious and saving, sacrificing luxury, pride, or anything else that may tempt them to spend a dollar or a dime aside from the actual necessities of life. yours truly, samuel peters."},{"identifier":1874010101202.0,"Newspaper":"New National Era","Bank":"FSB","Year":1874,"Month":1,"Day":1.0,"Title":"the freedman's savings and trust company","Text":"the fsb. a national savings bank. established march, 1865. chartered by the government of the united states. banking house 1507 pennsylvania avenue, opposite the treasury. five cents, or larger amounts, received on deposit. all profits paid to depositors as interest, not exceeding seven per cent, per annum. interest on sums of one dollar and upwards, beginning first of each month: payable 1st of january and 1st of july. every amount strictly confidential. principal office, washington d. c. branches in all cities and large towns of the south and southwest. open from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. each day, and on mondays and saturdays (for deposits only) from 6:30 to 8 p. m. don't waste money;
